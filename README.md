# FLIGHT_PRICE_EDA
Flight Price Data Analysis (EDA)

Project Overview:-------
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on flight price data to uncover insights about airfare trends, factors affecting ticket prices, and patterns in airline pricing strategies.

Dataset

Contains flight details such as airline, departure time, arrival time, duration, number of stops, source, destination, and price.

Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualizations)

Key Analysis
✔ Price distribution and factors influencing airfare
✔ Impact of airline, travel time, and stops on price
✔ Correlation between duration and price
✔ Analysis of most expensive and cheapest airlines
✔ Day-wise and month-wise price trends
✔ Airport-based pricing differences



Run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

📈 Sample Visualizations

Include some sample plots showcasing insights, such as:

Price distribution across airlines
